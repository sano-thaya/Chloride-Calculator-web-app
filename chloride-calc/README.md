A web-based application for calculating free chloride concentration (Cf) in concrete, converted from a Python desktop GUI.  
It provides interactive input, real-time graphing, and PDF export for academic and research purposes.

## 🔬 Scientific Background

Chloride ingress in concrete is a critical durability concern, especially in marine or saline environments.  
The **free chloride concentration (Cf)** at a location and time determines the risk of reinforcement corrosion.

This web app computes Cf(x, y, z, t) using a **multi-dimensional Fourier series expansion of Fick’s second law**, with adaptive convergence based on a user-defined tolerance.  
The methodology is based on **X. Qiu et al., 2024**.
